          <br></br>
          <p>Hopkins for the Homeless is a student organization under the Center for Social Concern</p>
          <p> at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>Our mission is to bring awareness to and alleviate homelessness in Baltimore. We achieve these aims by coordinating both on and off campus events throughout the year. By partnering Hopkins students with various homelessness advocacy groups, we work to make  significant steps in resolving an often misunderstood and crippling issue in Baltimore. </p>

          <br></br>
          <p>Hopkins for the Homeless will seek to bring awareness to the seriousness of homelessness by actively participating in the community and advocating for reform. We will seek to lobby and advocate for social change in the neighborhood and volunteer our time to alleviate the immediate effects of homelessness as well as hosting speaker events and walking tours to bring light onto the realities of homelessness. We also edit and write for Word on the Street, a paper written about homeless issues by people who have experienced homelessness. The paper is then sold by homeless vendors, providing them with an essential income. More details can be found on our website under Service. </p>
